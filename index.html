                <p>Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala, the land of righteousness and piety, is one of south India’s most renowned religious landmarks with a history as old as 800 years. Manjunatheshwara, the chief deity of the spiritual abode, has taken the form of a shivalinga and made immaculate, the temple town of Dharmasthala since and forever. Lord Manjunatheshwara, is being worshipped in a very unusual yet exceptionally inordinate manner in Shree kshetra dharmasthala, as this Shaiva temple is beseeched by Vaishnava priests and administered by Jain descendants.</p>
            <p>Dharmasthala”, the abode of dharma, is the quintessence of humanity and faith. As the name suggests, the word dharma in its truest sense means righteousness, it is the embodiment of the world’s most divine emotions in spite of one’s cast, creed or religion.</p>

                  <p class="card-text"> The Sharadamba Temple at Sringeri (Shringa giri in Sanskrit) is an 8th-century temple, founded by Sri Adi Shankaracharya. It housed a sandalwood statue of Shardamba in a standing posture, which was installed by Adi Shankarachaya until the Vijayanagara rulers and Sri Vidyaranya (12th Jagadguru) installed a seated gold statue of Sri Shardamba in the 14th century.</p>
                <p>Sankara is believed to have envisioned this place as the holiest where a snake hooded as an umbrella to protect a pregnant frog from hot Sun during its labour. [1] To commemorate this incident, a sculpture known as KAPPE SHANKARA is there on the footsteps to the river Tunga. This was the first place where Sankara is believed to have established one of the four major mutts.[2] As per Hindu legend, the place is associated with sage Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandakamuni. He did severe penance at this place, leading to the name Sringeri.</p>

                <p>Mullayanagiri is the highest peak in Karnataka, India. Mullayyanagiri is located at 13°23′26″N 75°43′18″E in the Chandra Dhrona Hill Ranges of the Western Ghats of Chikkamagaluru Taluk. With a height of 1,930 metres (6,330 ft), It is the fourth highest peak between Nilgiri hills and Himalayas next to Vavulmala, Chembra Peak and Banasura Hill.</p>
               
            <p>Mullayanagiri is one of the best trekking places in Karnataka and South India.[citation needed] The summit of Mullayanagiri also houses a police radio relay station. Seethalayyanagiri is a prominent peak is adjacent to this place. The peak gets its name from a small temple (gadduge/tomb) at the summit, which is dedicated to a sage “Mulappa swamy” who, is believed to have meditated at the caves only a couple of feet below the summit. The caves are accessible and not very deep, they have a direct entrance to the garbagudi of the temple, which is now blocked by the temple priests. Apart from multiple versions of folklore and strong Siddha culture around the belt, the origins or any information about the deity remains ambiguous. Mullai refers to forest in Old Kannada language.</p></div>
